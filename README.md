# temperature_humudity_at_home
This project aims to see if there is a correlation between  temperature and humudity at home and corresponding data from weather stations after Sep.2019 in Moers, Germany. 
Home Temperature and humidity data is captured with the help of a Arduino board. Arduino script is provided in the repository. Those data are stored in a Json file on Firebase cloud database. 
The weather data can be taken from German Weather Agency (opendata.dwd.de). The corresponding Jupyter files that are getting weather data, are also provided in the repository.
